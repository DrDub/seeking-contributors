# Adding Projects

To add your project, you will need several details. Follow these steps.

1. Project Name ( for example, "PySeas" is one of my repos that I am seeking contributors for, so the name is just "PySeas")
2. Description of your project (if applicable)
3. A `Badge` Generated with the ['helper_functions.ipynb' notebook](notebooks/helper_functions.ipynb). This file is included in this repo, and it will guide you through the process when you run it. It will likely take you around one minute.

This `Badge` will be added to the badge wall for users to peruse. The example badge below gives you an idea of how nice a project can look with just a few lines of extra formatting.

1. Now, all you need to do is copy the first markdown block, and paste it under the appropriate heading in the main [readme](/README.md) file.

2. Then add the second block of code (the table portion) to the [project_board.md](/project_board.md) file. This will be the table of the repositories that displays badging and descriptions for each project.
