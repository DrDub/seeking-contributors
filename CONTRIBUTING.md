Adding your project is as simple as copying the url of your repo and following the instructions below.

## Instructions
* Copy the url of your repo on GitHub.

* Open ['helper_functions.ipynb' notebook](notebooks/helper_functions.ipynb).

Once you have opened the notebook, you will see a function called `add_your_project` in the first cell. This function takes the url of your repo as an argument. All you have to do is run the notebook.

* A `Badge` Generated with the ['helper_functions.ipynb' notebook](notebooks/helper_functions.ipynb). This file is included in this repo, and it will guide you through the process when you run it. It will likely take you around one minute.


This `Badge` will be added to the badge wall for users to peruse. The example badge below gives you an idea of how nice a project can look with just a few lines of extra formatting.

* Now, all you need to do is copy the first markdown block, and paste it under the appropriate heading in the main [readme](/README.md) file.

Then add the second block of code (the table portion) to the [project_board.md](/project_board.md) file. This will be the table of the repositories that displays badging and descriptions for each project.
