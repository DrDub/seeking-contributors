# How to Support My Work

If you'd like to contribute to the hours, I spend staring at my screen in deep concentration, I welcome any caffeine donations. â˜• Also, if you'd like to sponsor a project you see on my page, please let me know where I should focus my attention. Open Source is a big brave new world. Cheers!
